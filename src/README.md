## Website Performance Optimization  - Project (@Udacity #nanodegree)

###Step 1: Critical Rendering Path (CRP) Optimization

#### Scope: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop for index.html

Find CRA Metrics[Critical Rendering Path](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884) and optimize them by:
- reducing the number of critical resources (4 - index.html + google fonts + style.css + analytics.js)
- reducing the number of critical bytes of critical resource files (4.21kB total - index.html(2.74kB) + google fonts  + style.css(1.47kB) + analytics.js), and
- shortening the critical path length (4)


Also, measure the score of index.html on [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/).
Both Mobile and Desktop scores were in the range of 50.

Optimize images
Properly formatting and compressing images can save many bytes of data.
Optimize the following images to reduce their size by 2.3MiB (99% reduction).
Compressing and resizing http://cameronwp.github.io/udportfolio/views/images/pizzeria.jpg could save 2.3MiB (99% reduction).
Losslessly compressing http://cameronwp.github.io/udportfolio/img/profilepic.jpg could save 9.5KiB (67% reduction).

Eliminate render-blocking JavaScript and CSS in above-the-fold content
Your page has 1 blocking script resources and 3 blocking CSS resources. This causes a delay in rendering your page.
None of the above-the-fold content on your page could be rendered without waiting for the following resources to load. Try to defer or asynchronously load blocking resources, or inline the critical portions of those resources directly in the HTML.
Remove render-blocking JavaScript:
http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js
Optimize CSS Delivery of the following:
http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700

## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
