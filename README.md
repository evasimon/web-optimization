## Website Performance Optimization - Project (@Udacity #frontendnanodegree)

### Step 1: Critical Rendering Path (CRP) Optimization
> **Scope:** Optimize PageSpeed Insights score of at least 90 for Mobile and Desktop for `index.html`.


### Step 2: Frame Rate Optimization
> **Scope:** Optimize `views/js/main.js` to make `views/pizza.html` render with a consistent frame-rate at 60fps when scrolling.


### Step 3: Computational Efficiency
> **Scope:** Using the pizza size slider on the `views/pizza.html` page, resize pizzas is less than 5 ms. 

### Step 4: Minification of CSS and JS, and Image Optimization
> **Scope:** Download, configure and implement task runner on the project using Grunt.

**How to run Grunt on this project?**

- Download the project assets and make sure `src` folder, `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` files are under one folder.
- Open your terminal window.
- Ensure that you have the _npm_ package manager or _Node.js_ installed and up-to-date by running `npm update -g npm` in your terminal.
- Install Grunt's command line interface (CLI) by running `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
- Since, `Gruntfile.js` and `package.json` are already configured for the project with the needed tasks and Grunt plugins --> you are ready to run Grunt:
    * Go to the project's root directory in your terminal.
    * Install project dependencies by running `npm install`.
    * Run Grunt with `grunt`.
